At **MSJ ARC**, we believe that our website should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability or circumstance. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## Measures to support accessibility

**Mission San Jose High School Amateur Radio Club** takes the following measures to ensure accessibility:

- Include accessibility throughout our development process
- Review accessibility in pull requests and code reviews
- Maintain issues  to track accessibility work
- Welcome and act on community accessibility feedback and audits

## Conformance status

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

**MSJ ARC's website** is **partially conformant** with WCAG 2.2 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
